# Fotomatic

A responsive and visually appealing landing page for Fotomatic, a fictional photo editing app, crafted as part of my journey to become a full-stack engineer. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and flexbox layout, featuring key app highlights—Instant Capture, Advanced Photo Editing, Sharing to Social Media, Custom Filters, Cloud Storage, and Real-Time Collaboration—with engaging sections and a modern tech-inspired design. The site is optimized for a seamless experience across devices, reflecting my focus on usability and aesthetics.

Built to hone my front-end development abilities, this webpage serves as a key piece in my portfolio. The use of CSS Flexbox ensures a flexible, modern layout, while hover effects demonstrate dynamic styling. Future enhancements could include JavaScript for advanced interactivity, such as a demo editor tool.
